OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH JAVA LABORATORY<br>
PART A – List of problems for which student should develop program and execute in the Laboratory<br>
<ol>
  <li>Write a java program that prints all real solutions to the quadratic equation
ax2+bx+c=0. Read in a, b, c and use the quadratic formula.</li>
  <li>Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it.
USN
Name
Branch
Phone
Write a Java program to create n Student objects and print the USN, Name, Branch, and Phone
of these objects with suitable headings.</li>
   <li>A. Write a program to check prime number
B.Write a program for Arithmetic calculator using switch case menu</li>
  <li>Design a super class called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this class
by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical (skills), and
Contract (period). Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three
categories.</li>
  <li> Write a java program demonstrating Method overloading and Constructor
overloading.</li>
  <li> Develop a java application to implement currency converter (Dollar to INR, EURO to
INR, Yen to INR and vice versa), distance converter (meter to KM, miles to KM and vice versa),
time converter (hours to minutes, seconds and vice versa) using packages.</li>
   <li>Write a program to generate the resume. Create 2 Java classes Teacher (data:
personal information, qualification, experience, achievements) and Student (data: personal
information, result, discipline) which implements the java interface Resume with the method
biodata().</li>
  <li> Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three
threads. First thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes
the square of the number and prints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.</li>
  <li>Write a program to perform string operations using ArrayList. Write functions for
the following a. Append - add at end b. Insert – add at particular index c. Search d. List all
string starts with given letter.</li>
  <li>Write a Java program to read two integers a and b. Compute a/b and print, when b
is not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.</li>
   <li>Write a java program that reads a file name from the user, displays information about
whether the file exists, whether the file is readable, or writable, the type of file and the length
of the file in bytes</li>
